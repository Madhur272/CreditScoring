# CreditScoring
Lenders utilise statistical analysis tools like credit scoring models to determine a borrower's creditworthiness. 
Based on a person's credit history, financial data, and other pertinent variables, it evaluates the risk of giving them money. 
The borrower is given a numerical score by the model, which aids lenders in making well-informed judgements about loan approval, interest rate setting, and credit limit determination. 
Higher credit scores translate into better loan conditions for the borrower since they reduce the lender's risk perception. 
Credit scoring models are essential to the financial sector because they make loan choices more efficient and impartial.

The model uses classification algorithms to forecast a person's creditworthiness based on past financial data. 

The model is trained with a 'train.csv' dataset and tested with 'test.csv', achieving 72% accuracy.

To personally test the model two files are used 'test_data.csv' and 'test_data_1.csv', one works for a single scenario, and the second works row by row.
